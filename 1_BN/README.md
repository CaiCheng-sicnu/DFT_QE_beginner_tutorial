# Two-dimensional boron nitride (1_BN)
Example on how to run calculations for a material that is not period in all dimension.
The system will still be calcualte using the periodic bounday condition.
The trick is to put enough vacuum between the 2D layer and the cell border, 
that the 2 layer next to each other will be far enough to not interact.

## Purpose
