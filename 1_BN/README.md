# Two-dimensional boron nitride (1_BN)
Example on how to run calculations for a material that is not periodic in all dimension.
The system will still be calculate using the periodic boundary condition.
The trick is to put enough vacuum between the 2D layer and the cell border, 
that the 2 layer next to each other will be far enough to not interact.

## Purpose
  1. Calculation on non fully periodic materials.
  2. Test the required vacuum/calculate the vacuum potential.

## Running the exercise
  1. Run the exercise from the folders following the numeric order
