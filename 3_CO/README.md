# Carbon monoxide (2_CO)
Example on how to run a calculaiton for a zero-dimensiona system (molecule/quantum-dot).

## Purpose
  1. Run a relax calculation and visualize the output using xcrysden
  2. Run a calculaiton for a molecule (0D system)
  3. Calculate the binding energy of a molecule
  4. Visualize the HOMO and LUMO of a molecule (charge density for specific k-point and band)

## Running the exercise
  1. Run the exercise from the folders following the numeric order
